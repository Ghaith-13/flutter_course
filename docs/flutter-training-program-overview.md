# Flutter Training Program Overview

This intensive Flutter training program transforms developers with Dart knowledge into proficient Flutter developers through structured, hands-on learning.

## Program Duration and Structure

**Duration:** 2-3 weeks (40+ hours per week, full-time)

### Three phases:

1. Foundation (Week 1: Days 1-3)
2. Application Development (Week 1: Day 4 - Week 2: Day 3)
3. Advanced Concepts & Final Project (Week 2: Day 4 - Week 3)

## Program Schedule

### Phase 1: Foundation (3 days)

#### Day 1: Dart Essentials
- Dart syntax, data types, functions, async/await, null safety
- **Assessment:** Dart fundamentals (2 hours)
  - Creates functions for data transformation, async data fetching, and state management

  - Includes practical coding exercises simulating Flutter-like patterns
  - Should be completed within 2 days after the module

#### Day 2: Flutter Fundamentals
- Widgets, stateful vs. stateless widgets, UI building, hot reload
- **Assessment:** Flutter widgets (3 hours)
  - Builds a user management interface with multiple widgets
  - Tests understanding of widgets, state, and UI composition
  - Implements a complete dashboard with user cards, lists, forms, and profiles
  - Should be completed within 4 days after the module

#### Day 3: State Management & Navigation
- Bloc, Provider, Riverpod, GetX, Navigator 2.0
